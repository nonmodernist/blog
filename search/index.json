[{"content":"One reason I love teaching film is because I vividly remember so many of the incredible people who taught it to me, along with their strategies for doing so. I have forgotten many, many other things from my life, but I still remember the playwriting teacher I had in high school who gave us the following analytical exercise: take the first and last image of any given film and demonstrate how those two images alone tell the story.\nI thought of this exercise recently as I was making notes on the structure of Gold Diggers of 1933, the pre-code, backstage, Depression-era musical released by Warner Bros. and choreographed/co-directed by Busby Berkeley.\nThe first shot of the film is a close up on a giant coin, featuring a woman\u0026rsquo;s face in profile and the year. It\u0026rsquo;s too big and too flat to look real, and we will soon figure out that it\u0026rsquo;s a prop in the movie\u0026rsquo;s first musical number, \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re in the Money.\u0026rdquo; What appears to be a pile of shiny coins will soon be revealed as the glittering scale armour of Ginger Rogers, who can\u0026rsquo;t even get through the whole manic opening number about the banishment of the Depression before the police arrive to repossess everything in the theatre, including the chorus girls\u0026rsquo; costumes.\nIn contrast, the final shot of the film is an extreme wide that finds Joan Blondell, in character as a street sex worker, surrounded by downtrodden men and women meant to personify the suffering of the Depression-era working classes. Behind them, three arched platforms are populated by World War I soldiers in silhouette (a bleak twist on the silhoutted women who appear during the earlier song \u0026ldquo;Pettin\u0026rsquo; in the Park\u0026rdquo;). And above that, the theatre\u0026rsquo;s curtain hangs almost out of frame, reminding us that this is the climactic finale of the show-within-a-show (or movie, in this case).\nThat narrative structure is interesting, I think, because at first glance the above two shots don\u0026rsquo;t really seem to tell the story at all. Our gold diggers, Polly (Ruby Keeler), Carol (Joan Blondell), and Trixie (Aline MacMahon), begin the story starving in a one room apartment, stealing milk from the neighbor and a dress from a friend (Fay, played by Rogers). But by the end of the movie they have all snagged the rich husbands of their dreams—and some of them are even in love.\nSo the plots of the movie and the show-within-the-movie travel in opposite directions: the movie\u0026rsquo;s romance plot starts low and ends high, while the show\u0026rsquo;s musical numbers take us from the highs of being in the money to the lows of Carol\u0026rsquo;s torch song.\nNarrative in the shape of an X This contrapposto1 structure allows for the kind of delayed gratification Busby Berkeley seemed to love. After the cops\u0026rsquo; rude interruption of the opening song and dance number, it\u0026rsquo;s 35 minutes until the film gives us a full musical sequence. This opening section is instead filled with snatches of songs from rehearsals and songwriting sessions, as producer and talent work together to take the \u0026ldquo;Forgotten Melody\u0026rdquo; revue from idea to reality.2\nWith the conclusion of \u0026ldquo;Pettin\u0026rsquo; in the Park,\u0026rdquo; the first section of the film—the Depression-steeped struggle to put on the show—comes to an end. The revue has gone on, with secretly wealthy songwriter Brad Roberts (Dick Powell) both putting up the funding and filling in for the aging \u0026ldquo;juvenile\u0026rdquo; lead.\nBut the solution to the problems of the first section—how will they fund the show and who will star in it?—create the problems of the film\u0026rsquo;s second section. Brad, who was happy to put up the money but wouldn\u0026rsquo;t go onstage until Trixie tells him that if he doesn\u0026rsquo;t, the chorines will have to resort to sex work, has caused quite the society stir by appearing in the show. We soon learn that he is not a bank robber, as Trixie believes, but the wayward son of a wealthy family. His brother Lawrence (Warren William) and family lawyer Peabody (Guy Kibbee) arrive to put an end to his Broadway songwriting aspirations, but they are no match for Trixie and Carol.\nAs a result of the Depression, films in the first half of the 30s favored a hard-hitting, anti-establishment mood… only those antics of the monied class caricaturing them as willful, spoilt, manic and otherwise unsympathetic were accepted by moviegoers… this mood reached its climax with films like Public Enemy and Gold Diggers of 1933.\n—John Kobal, Gotta Sing, Gotta Dance p. 93-4\nWhen the plot interrupts the music The girls take these self-important rich men for quite a ride, in the gold-digging romance plot that takes up the majority of the rest of the film. Again Berkeley and director Mervyn LeRoy delay the resumption of the musical numbers: it takes another 40 minutes and the initial resolution of the romance plot before the next Berkeley musical extravaganza, \u0026ldquo;The Shadow Waltz.\u0026rdquo;\nWe\u0026rsquo;re used to thinking about musical numbers as either furthering or interrupting the plot. But Gold Diggers of 1933 presents a third possibility: here it\u0026rsquo;s the plot that interrupts the music. This is made literal in the third and final section of the film, when Lawrence\u0026rsquo;s final threat to Brad and Polly\u0026rsquo;s romance prevents the \u0026ldquo;Forgotten Man\u0026rdquo; finale from starting.\nThe movie\u0026rsquo;s reality and the world of show biz begin to merge, as producer Barney spoils Lawrence\u0026rsquo;s plan by recognizing the \u0026ldquo;cop\u0026rdquo; he has brought in as a Broadway ham actor. With the threat revealed to be fake and all obstacles overcome, the movie and the show are free to conclude with the \u0026ldquo;Forgotten Man number\u0026rdquo; previously announced.\n\u0026ldquo;Won\u0026rsquo;t you bring him back again?\u0026rdquo; Berkeley’s big numbers, generally sung by Dick Powell, Ruby Keeler, or Joan Blondell, comprised one of the Hollywood musical’s unique styles, instantly recognizable. Even more basic to these films, however, is the characteristic Warners political reading that shapes them. Gold Diggers of 1933 is suffused with Depression panic. Performing is work; one works to eat. And, lest we forget, the film closes with “Remember My Forgotten Man,” a Berkeley phantasmagoria on the socially disinherited war veteran.\n—Ethan Mordden, The Hollywood Studios p. 236\nIt could be folly to try to explain what Berkeley meant by any of the finales he crafted for Warner Bros.\u0026rsquo;s backstage musicals in this era. 42nd Street (1933) has Powell and Keeler waving placidly from the top of a skyscraper, a positively bland ending compared to the opium-induced Orientalist fever dream that ends Footlight Parade (1933), or Winnifred Shaw plummeting to her death during the finale of Gold Diggers of 1935 (1935).\nBut let\u0026rsquo;s return to the contrast between Gold Diggers of 1933\u0026rsquo;s opening and closing shots. Ginger Rogers\u0026rsquo;s Fay has previously been evicted from the film by Trixie for threatening the triple-marriage resolution that lets us reach the finale. Instead of her falsely-optimistic Pig Latin nonsense (\u0026ldquo;ear-way in-hay the oney-may\u0026rdquo;), we end with a heightened version of Warners\u0026rsquo; characteristic social(ist) realism, a Broadway fantasy more real than the suggestion that starving showgirls can be rescued by love—or at least by easily-manipulated rich men.\nAt the same time, the film\u0026rsquo;s contrapposto plots are always commenting on each other. \u0026ldquo;Remember My Forgotten Man\u0026rdquo; isn\u0026rsquo;t just about the men who returned injured from World War I only to end up waiting in line for a single slice of bread during the Depression. It\u0026rsquo;s also about the women, who have even fewer options for economic stability. As Etta Moten sings, \u0026ldquo;forgetting him, you see / means you\u0026rsquo;re forgetting me.\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s fun to watch chiseling showgirls bilk rich men out of thousands—but it\u0026rsquo;s also a reminder of the very real, devastating consequences of the United States\u0026rsquo; nearly non-existant social safety net. Gold Diggers of 1933 uses its narrative structure to make this point: the gold digger and the street sex worker are but two sides of the same big, flat, fake coin that opens the film.\nI\u0026rsquo;m borrowing this term from classical Greek sculpture; it means \u0026ldquo;counterpoise\u0026rdquo; in Italian.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nTechnically, as a \u0026ldquo;revue,\u0026rdquo; Barney Hopkins\u0026rsquo; show-within-the-movie doesn\u0026rsquo;t have a plot. But if we map the musical numbers shown in the film, we can still find a plot trajectory.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":"2025-02-15T17:44:35.544Z","image":"https://nonmodernist.com/blog/gold-diggers-1933/golddiggers1933b_hu9209777067052495636.png","permalink":"https://nonmodernist.com/blog/gold-diggers-1933/","title":"Gold Diggers of 1933"},{"content":"When does the history of cinema begin? It sounds like a simple question, but the answer is surprisingly slippery. We could start in December of 1895 (or was it October?), when the Lumière brothers presented what was likely the first commercial film screening. Or we could start in late 1894 (or early 1895?) when W.K.L. Dickson shot The Dickson Experimental Sound Film, creating what was likely the first film with synchronized sound. But we could also start as early as 1888 when Louis Le Prince used a single-lens camera and paper film to create the Roundhay Garden Scene, or in 1878 when Eadweard Muybridge shot his first motion studies, or even in 1874 when Jules Janssen tested if his \u0026ldquo;photographic revolver\u0026rdquo; could capture the transit of Venus across the sun.\nIn reality \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; technologies don\u0026rsquo;t emerge fully formed in a singular historic moment; they are always the result of numerous previous developments. The process is iterative.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s no different with cinema: centuries of technological innovation led, eventually, to the invention of moving pictures. Here, briefly, are a few.\nOptical toys Also known as “philosophical toys,” these objects represent some of the earliest animation technologies available.\nMagic lanterns use light shined through transparent colored material to project images onto a surface. The Phénakisticope (1832) is a disc with slits and a succession of images. When the disc is spun and the viewer looks through the slits into a mirror, the succession of images gives the appearance of a single moving image (a phenomenon known as apparent motion). The zoetrope (1834) operates on the same principle but removed the need for a mirror. Viewers look through slits in a rotating cylinder at images arranged around the inside. The Kinematoscope (1861) had viewers look through slits at images on the blades of a rotating paddle, which was operated by a hand crank. The praxinoscope (1877) improved on the zoetrope by using a set of mirrors to reflect the image, alleviating the need for the viewer to look through slits. This brightens the image. Eadweard Muybridge\u0026rsquo;s zoopraxiscope (1879) combined the principles of the magic lantern and the phénakisticope to project a succession of images from a spinning glass disc.1 I first learned about optical toys and their relationship to film from Patrick Ellis, when our paths crossed at Georgia Tech. Patrick had a collection of reproduction optical toys that he would use in his classes, and he generous lent them to me when I taught my first course where film was the primary focus. Watching students learn about early moving picture technology was so fun that, when I left GT for TCU, one of the first things I did was get a micro-grant to buy the department our own collection of zoetropes, praxinoscopes, phenikisticopes, and even some humble flipbooks.\nPhotography The possibility for photography rests on two combined principles: the ability of an image to be projected via a camera obscura and the fact that certain materials change when they are exposed to light. In the early 19th century, artists and inventors worked to perfect the process of combining these principles to create photographic images.\nThe oldest surviving photographic image was created by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce in 1827. It shows a view of buildings and countryside, taken from a high window.\nIn 1838, Louis Daguerre created an image that is widely thought to be the first photograph containing people. However, the image took so long to expose that only two figures who stood still can be seen.\nWomen also experimented with photography from its earliest era. The first known photograph by a woman is an image of a leaf, taken in 1839 by Sarah Anne Bright.2 Below are some examples of early photographs taken by women.\nIn the United States, portrait photography became especially popular, leading to portrait studios in every city. Augustus Washington, a free person of color born in New Jersey, opened his own photography studio in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1846. He took the first photographs of his fellow abolitionist John Brown in 1846 or 1847.\nIn the 1870s, photographer Eadweard Muybridge was hired by Leland Stanford to photograph a horse. Muybridge spent most of the decade working out how to expose an image fast enough to capture a galloping horse.3 By 1878, with the help of some railroad engineers, Muybridge devised a way to take not just one but a sequence of photographs of a moving subject.4\nMuybridge spent another 10 years photographing animals and humans in motion. He also invented the zoopraxiscope to demonstrate moving illustrations based on his photographs. Because the zoopraxiscope caused image distortion when projected, the photographs had to be recreated as illustrations that compensated for this foreshortening effect.\nMeanwhile, in 1882, Étienne-Jules Marey devised a means of taking 12 photographs per second, using a mechanism that looked like a gun. He was soon able to push this up to 30 frames per second. Unlike Muybridge\u0026rsquo;s motion studies, which used separate cameras to photograph onto separate plates, Marey\u0026rsquo;s use of a single camera allowed him to expose multiple images on the same glass plate or strip of photographic paper.\nIn 1889, George Eastman\u0026rsquo;s photography company began selling a flexible celluloid film stock that was more durable than paper. Eastman\u0026rsquo;s company also created the first film roll system and the sprocket holes that allow film to be advanced inside the camera. This proved useful not only for still photographers, who no longer had to carry heavy glass plates, but also for budding motion picture photographers, as it brought them even closer to being able to expose the hundreds of frames need to capture more than a few seconds of motion.\nSound recording and playback The earliest known device for recording sound, called the phonautograph, was invented in France in the 1850s. The device recorded a visual representation of soundwaves on paper or glass, but it was not originally possible to play them back.\nAccording to Wikipedia:\nApparently, it did not occur to anyone before the 1870s that the recordings, called phonautograms, contained enough information about the sound that they could, in theory, be used to recreate it. Because the phonautogram tracing was an insubstantial two-dimensional line, direct physical playback was impossible in any case. However, several phonautograms recorded before 1861 were successfully played as sound in 2008 by optically scanning them and using a computer to process the scans into digital audio files. 5\nIn the 1870s and 1880s, Thomas Edison and other inventors worked out various ways to both record sound and play it back, by scratching grooves into soft materials and then retracing those grooves while amplifying the resulting vibrations.\nBy the late 1880s, all of the major components necessary for the invention of moving pictures were in place.\nEadweard Muybridge, Zoopraxographer: The Life and Work of the Photographer and Cinema Pioneer (1975, dir. by Thom Andersen).

And as such, one would assume that it has to be global, composed of variegated regional formations.\u0026rdquo;\nIn 2021, Kier-La Janisse and Severin Films released an extensive documentary about the history of folk horror, titled Woodlands Dark and Days Bewitched, along with an accompanying boxset called All the Haunts Be Ours, which contains 20 feature films. In 2024, Severin Films followed this up with All the Haunts Be Ours volume 2, containing 24 feature films. Both boxsets also contain a wealth of special features, including interviews, short films, and more.\nIn the fall of 2024, I taught a class on \u0026ldquo;Genre in Film\u0026rdquo; with a focus on folk horror. After 3.5 months of watching movies and discussing them with students, I put together the following list of the genre\u0026rsquo;s tropes, and an accompanying list of folk horror films.\nGenre Tropes Rural communities and locations Folk horror stories often take place in rural communities and locations, such as villages1 or very small towns,2 farms and fields,3 forests,4 or islands.5\nFilms like Lokis: A Manuscript of Professor Wittembach (1970, Poland), Let\u0026rsquo;s Scare Jessica to Death (1971, US), Ganja \u0026amp; Hess (1973, US), The Ash Tree (1975, UK), The Rites of May (1976, Philippines), and La Llorona (2019, Guatemala) locate their action primarily within a large, isolated house that operates as an outpost on the edge of a rural locale.\nOthers, like Lake of the Dead (1958, Norway), Hour of the Wolf (1968, Sweden), Deliverance (1972), Butter on the Latch (2015, US), and Midsommar (2019, US), take place during vacations or festivals in scenic rural locales.\nCandyman (1992, US) is a somewhat rare example of a folk horror film with an urban setting, although one could argue that the Cabrini-Green housing project in the film serves as the 1990s equivalent of a farm or other rural place—an isolated community suffering from what Ruth Wilson Gilmore calls “organized abandonment.”6\nFolk horror\u0026rsquo;s focus on rurality connects to the 19th-century origins of folklore studies, when European ethnographers traveled to rural areas to collect folklore from illiterate, poor communities.\nThe Outsider, Skeptic, or Ethnographer Rural and isolated communities are thrown into relief by the arrival of an outsider7 or the presence of a skeptic.8 Sometimes this outsider is literally an ethnographer collecting folklore from the community,9 or an archaeologist or other academic studying ancient sites.10\nDr. Dejan Ognjanovic points out that the trope of the outsider coming into a folk community is more common in Western or Anglicized folk horror. In Slavic folk horror, he argues, “someone is already immersed in this value system, and whatever happens in this plot arises from within.”11\nAncient sacred sites Characters visit ancient sacred sites for research,12 rituals,13 or simply as tourists.14\nMany horror films from settler colonial countries include the cliché “Indian burial ground” trope, including The Last Wave (1977, Australia), The Amityville Horror (1979, US), The Shining (1980, US), Eyes of Fire (1983, US), Kadaicha (1988, Australia), Pet Sematary (1989, US), and Grim Prairie Tales (1990, US), to name just a few. But as Jesse Wente says, “there is no such thing as an Indian burial ground… [that is] a figment of the Western imagination.” Wente\u0026rsquo;s point is, in part, that Hollywood has reduced multinational peoples into one fictional category, “Indian.”15\nWitchcraft, shamanism, and other forms of folk magic Witchcraft in folk horror is often treated as an ancient practice that has been carried on through the centuries, surviving despite modernization,16 or as something that has been resurrected from a time long gone.17 It can be part of a region\u0026rsquo;s pagan past18 or treated as devil worship. We might differentiate these latter films from ones in which the Devil literally appears.19\nShamans also feature in folk horror films, especially films from cultures with shamanic traditions, such as The White Reindeer (1952, Finland), Io Island (1977, South Korea), and The Medium (2021, Thailand).\nOther forms of folk magic, including hoodoo (often mistakenly referred to as \u0026ldquo;voodoo\u0026rdquo;),20 rootwork, and brujeria, also appear in films like I Walked with a Zombie (1943, US), The Amulet of Ogum (1974, Brazil), Voodoo Black Exorcist (1974, Spain), Angel Heart (1987, US), The Believers (1987, US), and The Serpent and the Rainbow (1988, US).\nCults Isolated religious communities develop extreme beliefs and practices in films like Eye of the Devil (1966, UK), Crowhaven Farm (1970, US), The Wicker Man (1972, UK), Children of the Corn (1984, US), The Dark Secret of Harvest Home (1978, US), Alison\u0026rsquo;s Birthday (1981, Australia), Apostle (2018, US), Midsommar (2019, US), and Incantation (2022, Taiwan).\nHuman sacrifice Cults and other religious groups ritualistically kill one or more humans (or at least try to) for the benefit of the community in films like Witchfinder General (1968, UK), The Lottery (1969, US), Blood on Satan\u0026rsquo;s Claw (1971, UK), The Wicker Man (1972, UK), The Ritual (2017, UK), Tumbbad (2018, India), and Midsommar (2019, US).\nAnimal transformation Both women and men transform into various animals, including bears,21 cats,22 reindeer,23 wolves,24 and llamas.25 The transformation is often the result of a curse (as opposed to a bite).\nVampirism Folk horror\u0026rsquo;s vampires are less Dracula and more Nosferatu—not sleek and urbane but monstrous and animalistic.26 The major exception to this is Ganja \u0026amp; Hess (1973, US).\nVengeful ghosts Culturally-specific versions of the vengeful ghost appear in films like Bakeneko: A Vengeful Spirit (1968, Japan), The Rites of May (1976, Philippines), Sundelbolong (1981, Indonesia), Pontianak Harum Sundal Malam (2004, Malaysia), Demon (2015, Poland), and La Llorona (2019, Guatemala).\nFolk horror chain In contrast to the above list, Adam Scovell\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;folk horror chain\u0026rdquo; is a narrative theory that suggests folk horror films are united by \u0026ldquo;a linking set of narrative traits that have causational and interlinking consequences.\u0026rdquo;27 The four elements of the folk horror chain are:\nLandscape Folk horror films emphasize the landscape in which they are set. Isolation The landscape leads to the isolation of the characters. Skewed morals Isolation leads to a skewed sense of morals or beliefs. The happening The skewed morals or beliefs of the community lead to a happening (often a summoning). For example, in The White Reindeer (1952, Finland), Satan\u0026rsquo;s Feats in the Village of Leva-e-Traz (1967, Brazil), Leptirica (1973, Yugoslavia), The Dark Secret of Harvest Home (1978, US), The Witch (2015, US).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe Wailing (2016, South Korea), When Evil Lurks (2023, Argentina).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nCrowhaven Farm (1970, US), Blood on Satan\u0026rsquo;s Claw (1971, UK), Children of the Corn (1984, US), A Field in England (2013, UK).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nKuroneko (1968, Japan), Eyes of Fire (1983, US), The Enchanted (1984), The Blair Witch Project (1999, US), Roh (2019, Malaysia).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe Wicker Man (1972, UK), Io Island (1977, South Korea).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n\u0026ldquo;Organized Abandonment w/ Ruth Wilson Gilmore.\u0026rdquo; Death Panel Podcast, October 6, 2022.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nRobin Redbreast (1970, UK), The Wicker Man (1972, UK), Children of the Corn (1984, US), Clearcut (1991, Canada).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nNight of the Demon (1957, UK), Night of the Eagle (1962, UK) Whistle and I\u0026rsquo;ll Come to You (1968, UK).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe City of the Dead (1960, UK), Lokis (1970, Poland), The Savage Hunt of King Stakh (1979, USSR), Candyman (1992, US), The Medium (2021, Thailand).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThe Sign of Death (1939, Mexico), A Warning to the Curious (1972, UK), Children of the Stones (1977, UK), The Dreaming (1988, Australia).\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nWoodlands Dark and Days Bewitched: A History of Folk Horror.

Paint circling a nipple, lips being licked, a shot of lingerie being smoothed over soft skin… women were delicate and needy creatures, “masterpieces” as more than one of these short films argues. If hardcore porn is all about the money shot—incontrovertible proof of a man’s orgasm—softcore in this era hinged wholly on impossible-to-confirm, luscious, drawn out femme pleasure.\nIn Lizzie Borden’s way-too-short first segment, a female therapist records her patient’s sexual fantasies and then acts them out for herself. Or at least dresses up like she’s going to? This one feels like the first act of a longer story but it cuts off frustratingly before events actually get going.\nThe segment by Linda Hassani (who directed Dark Angel: The Ascent, a straight-to-vhs movie I adore) is about a prisoner using astral projection to find out if his wife has been cheating while he’s been locked up. She hasn’t been—she’s too busy masturbating while staring at his picture. Nevertheless things go badly, in a Twilight Zone sort of way.\nBorden has another segment that she both wrote and directed, this one about a woman whose husband is sexually bored with her, and so stages a series of escalating encounters between her and other men.\nThe interstitials are highkey Vertigo Comics aesthetics and I yelled every single time a Paul Valery or Ben Jonson quote popped up to frame the next short film. I have absolutely no clue who Playboy thought was the audience for this Jungian highbrow fantasy fest, but thank goodness it has been preserved because I loved it.\nExcept for the Alexander Payne segment, though, which was kinda racist.\n(This relatively obscure film is streaming here.)\n","date":"2024-04-28T21:52:54Z","image":"https://nonmodernist.com/blog/playboys-inside-out/insideout_hu13549006949965522001.png","permalink":"https://nonmodernist.com/blog/playboys-inside-out/","title":"Playboy's Inside Out"},{"content":"This is a recently restored film, stitched together from two different prints for two different markets, which I watched through the online version of Le Giornate del cinema muto (also known as the Pordenone Silent Film Festival).\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how a movie magazine summarized the film\u0026rsquo;s plot in 1921:\nMa Birdsong, her son Jimmie, and her daughter Essie live together in New York City\u0026rsquo;s East Side. Essie, enamored with the city\u0026rsquo;s night life, becomes an usherette in a cheap theater where she falls in love with Joe Ullman, a crooked ticket speculator. Her ailing mother repeatedly asks to meet Essie\u0026rsquo;s fiancé, but Joe always has a ready excuse to decline. Following a heart attack, Ma makes another plea to meet Joe. Essie finds him in a poolroom, but he scornfully refuses to accompany her. In desperation, Essie relates her story to a stranger; he agrees to pose as the girl’s fiancé for the sake of her mother. Ma Birdsong dies, secure in the thought that Essie is to marry \u0026ldquo;a real man.\u0026rdquo; Essie later falls in love with the stranger and they marry.\nFrances Marion wrote and directed this Fannie Hurst adaptation, after having written the adaptation of Hurst\u0026rsquo;s Humoresque the previous year. That film was directed by Frank Borzage, who was originally been set to direct this one as well, according to the AFI\u0026rsquo;s movie magazine research. Instead Marion took over, making this her directorial debut. She would go on to direct two more films, The Love Light (1921) and The Song of Love (1923).\nJust Around the Corner, based on a short story titled \u0026ldquo;The Superman,\u0026rdquo; is a Fannie Hurst tale through and through—the story of working poor New Yorkers crowded into a tenement, struggling to lead lives that matter, with family tragedy just around the corner\u0026hellip;\nIn it, we meet the Birdsong family: brother and sister Jimmie (Lewis Sargent) and Essie (Sigrid Holmquist, called \u0026ldquo;the Mary Pickford of Sweden\u0026rdquo;), and their mother (Margaret Seddon), who is slowly dying of an incurable heart ailment.\nThe hat shop scene early on is a fascinating representation of women\u0026rsquo;s material labor at the time (and maybe a nod to Edith Wharton\u0026rsquo;s The House of Mirth?). Hurst and Marion are bold in their pro-labor feminist politics, deftly showing-not-telling that bosses exploit both women\u0026rsquo;s labor and their bodies, and that poor women are forced to accept both the illegal working conditions and the sexual assault because they need money to survive.\nIronically, when Essie wants to take a job as a theatre usher for better pay, her mother and brother object because of the job\u0026rsquo;s connotations of prostitution. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s night work!\u0026rdquo; Ma Birdsong exclaims. As though Essie wasn\u0026rsquo;t already getting her breasts groped by her aggressive sweatshop boss!\nThe film starts to drag a bit as it shifts into full melodrama mode, pairing Essie off with a bad beau who keeps dodging her attempts to bring him home to meet her family. Despite her anti-sex work stance, the sight of Ma Birdsong waiting endlessly at the set dinner table, adjusting the silverware again and again, broke my heart. Unfortunately, the story moves slowly and predictably in this section, really sucking the energy out of things.\nThe pace picks up somewhat towards the end thanks to the intervention of a big sweet hunk, played by Marion\u0026rsquo;s real-life husband and literally credited as \u0026ldquo;The Real Man,\u0026rdquo; who arrives just in time to do a whole heap of emotional labor and teach everybody a lesson about non-toxic masculinity. Even in 1921 we loved a deus ex himbo.\n","date":"2022-10-02T00:04:15.606Z","image":"https://nonmodernist.com/blog/just-around-the-corner/cornerposter_hu15065214498822476316.png","permalink":"https://nonmodernist.com/blog/just-around-the-corner/","title":"Just Around the Corner"}]
